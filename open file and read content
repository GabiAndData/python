1. Using Python's open function
  # Open the file in read ('r') mode
    file = open('file.txt', 'r')

2. Using 'with' statement
  # Open the file using 'with' in read ('r') mode
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # further code

============================================================

1. Reading the entire content
# Reading and Storing the Entire Content of a File
# Using the read method, you can retrieve the complete content of a file
# and store it as a string in a variable for further processing or display.

# Step 1: Open the file you want to read
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:

    # Step 2: Use the read method to read the entire content of the file
    file_stuff = file.read()

    # Step 3: Now that the file content is stored in the variable 'file_stuff',
    # you can manipulate or display it as needed.
    # For example, let's print the content to the console:
    print(file_stuff)

# Step 4: The 'with' statement automatically closes the file when it's done,
# ensuring proper resource management and preventing resource leaks.

2. Reading the content line by line
file = open('file.txt', 'r')

# Reading line by line: Now, you can use readline() to read one line from the file at a time. It's like turning the pages of the book, but here, you're getting one sentence (or line) at each turn.
line1 = file.readline()  # Reads the first line
line2 = file.readline()  # Reads the second line

# Using the lines: You can do things with each line you read. For example, you can print it, check if it contains specific words, or save it somewhere else.
print(line1)  # Print the first line
if 'important' in line2:
    print('This line is important!')

# Looping through lines: Typically, you use a loop to read lines until no more lines are left. t's like reading the entire book, line by line.
while True:
    line = file.readline()
    if not line:
        break  # Stop when there are no more lines to read
    print(line)

# Closing the book: When you're done reading, it's essential to close the file using file.close() to make sure you're not wasting resources.
file.close()
