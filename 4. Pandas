Here are some key features and functionalities of Pandas:

Data Structures: Pandas offers two primary data structures - DataFrame and Series.

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array, essentially a single column or row of data.
Data Import and Export: Pandas makes it easy to read data from various sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, and more. It can also export data to these formats, enabling seamless data exchange.

Data Merging and Joining: You can combine multiple DataFrames using methods like merge and join, similar to SQL operations, to create more complex datasets from different sources.

Efficient Indexing: Pandas provides efficient indexing and selection methods, allowing you to access specific rows and columns of data quickly.

Custom Data Structures: You can create custom data structures and manipulate data in ways that suit your specific needs, extending Pandas' capabilities.

What is a Series?
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in Pandas. It can be thought of as a single column of data with labels or indices for each element. You can create a Series from various data sources, such as lists, NumPy arrays, or dictionaries
Here's a basic example of creating a Series in Pandas:


import pandas as pd

# Create a Series from a list
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)


In this example, we've created a Series named s with numeric data. Notice that Pandas automatically assigned numerical indices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to each element, but you can also specify custom labels if needed.

=============================================================================================

Accessing Elements in a Series
You can access elements in a Series using the index labels or integer positions. Here are a few common methods for accessing Series data:

Accessing by label

print(s[2])     # Access the element with label 2 (value 30)

Accessing by position

print(s.iloc[3]) # Access the element at position 3 (value 40)


Accessing multiple elements

print(s[1:4])   # Access a range of elements by label

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================


What is a DataFrames?
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types. Think of it as a table where each column represents a variable, and each row represents an observation or data point. DataFrames are suitable for a wide range of data, including structured data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, and more.

Creating DataFrames from Dictionaries:
DataFrames can be created from dictionaries, with keys as column labels and values as lists representing rows.


import pandas as pd
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
        'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

=============================================================================================
Column Selection:
You can select a single column from a DataFrame by specifying the column name within double brackets.
Multiple columns can be selected in a similar manner, creating a new DataFrame.

print(df['Name'])  # Access the 'Name' column
=============================================================================================
Accessing Rows:
You can access rows by their index using .iloc[] or by label using .loc[].

print(df.iloc[2])   # Access the third row by position
print(df.loc[1])    # Access the second row by label

=============================================================================================
Slicing:
You can slice DataFrames to select specific rows and columns.

print(df[['Name', 'Age']])  # Select specific columns
print(df[1:3])             # Select specific rows

=============================================================================================
Finding Unique Elements:
Use the unique method to determine the unique elements in a column of a DataFrame.

unique_dates = df['Age'].unique()

=============================================================================================
Conditional Filtering:
You can filter data in a DataFrame based on conditions using inequality operators.
For instance, you can filter albums released after a certain year.

high_above_102 = df[df['Age'] > 25]

=============================================================================================
Saving DataFrames:
To save a DataFrame to a CSV file, use the to_csv method and specify the filename with a “.csv” extension.Pandas provides other functions for saving DataFrames in different formats.

df.to_csv('trading_data.csv', index=False)

=============================================================================================
DataFrame Attributes and Methods
DataFrames provide numerous attributes and methods for data manipulation and analysis, including:

shape: Returns the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
info(): Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.
describe(): Generates summary statistics for numerical columns.
head(), tail(): Displays the first or last n rows of the DataFrame.
mean(), sum(), min(), max(): Calculate summary statistics for columns.
sort_values(): Sort the DataFrame by one or more columns.
groupby(): Group data based on specific columns for aggregation.
fillna(), drop(), rename(): Handle missing values, drop columns, or rename columns.
apply(): Apply a function to each element, row, or column of the DataFrame.
